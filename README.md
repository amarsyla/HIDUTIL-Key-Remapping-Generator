# HIDUTIL key remapping generator for MacOS ‚å®

Basic MacOS key remapping without external software using [hidutil](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2450/_index.html). With most of the key remapping software not working in MacOS Big Sur Beta, this is the easiest way to do it.

## Instructions

1. Open the [hidutil generator tool](https://hidutil-generator.netlify.app/)
2. Setup your key remaps
3. Copy the generated configuration to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.local.KeyRemapping.plist`
4. Reboot computer, or run `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.local.KeyRemapping.plist`

## Setting up locally
